# Netflix-TV-Show-and-Movies-Data-Analysis
This project involves analyzing a dataset of Netflix TV shows and movies to gain insights into the distribution and trends of various attributes such as content type, age certifications, release years, ratings, genres, and production countries. The analysis is performed using Python with libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
